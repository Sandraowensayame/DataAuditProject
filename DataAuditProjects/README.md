- **reports/**: Final outputs (`ICD9_Audit_Dashboard.pdf`, error charts).
- **dashboards/**: Power BI `.pbix` files.

## ⚡️ Key Metrics
- Total Records Analyzed
- Audit Error Count
- Audit Error Rate (%)
- Error Rate by Gender, Admission Type, and other demographics

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, FPDF): Data processing and automated reporting
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and data visualization

## 🚀 Outcome
A clean, well-documented data auditing project that demonstrates:
- Data wrangling and cleaning
